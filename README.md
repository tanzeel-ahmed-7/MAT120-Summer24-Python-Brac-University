# MAT120-Summer24-Python-Brac-University
This course taught me Integral Calculus and Differential Equations. It had a small Python programming lab which was mandatory to attend and complete. A final assignment was given at the end of the course. I lost the actual submission file but I had the codes so only those are attached.
